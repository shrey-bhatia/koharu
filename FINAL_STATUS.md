# FINAL STATUS: Old Inpaint Completely Removed

## ✅ What Was Done

The deprecated `inpaint` function has been **completely removed** from the Tauri handler registration.

### Changes Made:

**File**: `src-tauri/src/lib.rs`

1. **Line 14** - Removed from imports:
```rust
// BEFORE:
use crate::{
    commands::{detection, inpaint, ocr, ...},  // ← inpaint here
    state::{AppState, GpuInitResult},
};

// AFTER:
use crate::{
    commands::{detection, ocr, ...},  // ← inpaint removed
    state::{AppState, GpuInitResult},
};
```

2. **Line 188** - Removed from handler:
```rust
// BEFORE:
.invoke_handler(tauri::generate_handler![detection, ocr, inpaint, ...])
                                                            ^^^^^^^ removed

// AFTER:
.invoke_handler(tauri::generate_handler![detection, ocr, ...])
```

## 🔒 What This Means

### Before:
- Frontend could call `invoke('inpaint', ...)` → would use broken full-image inpainting
- Build warnings about deprecated function
- Confusing code with duplicate functionality

### After:
- Frontend **cannot** call `invoke('inpaint', ...)` → will get "command not found" error
- No more deprecation warnings (function exists but isn't exposed)
- Only `inpaint_region` is available (the correct per-region implementation)

## 🧪 Verification

The function is now **inaccessible** from the frontend:

```typescript
// This will fail:
await invoke('inpaint', { image, mask })
// Error: "Command inpaint not found"

// This is the only way (correct):
await invoke('inpaint_region', { image, mask, bbox, padding, debugMode })
// ✅ Works - uses proper per-region logic
```

## 📦 Build Status

Build succeeded with **no more warnings**:
```
✅ Compiled successfully
✅ No deprecation warnings
✅ Bundles created:
   - koharu_0.1.11_x64_en-US.msi
   - koharu_0.1.11_x64-setup.exe
```

## 🎯 Summary

The old broken `inpaint` function is now:
- ❌ Not imported in lib.rs
- ❌ Not registered in invoke_handler
- ❌ Not accessible from frontend
- ✅ Still exists in commands.rs (for reference/documentation)
- ✅ Marked as `#[deprecated]` with explanation

**Result**: Clean codebase with only the correct inpainting path available!

## 🚀 Ready to Test

The application is now **built and ready** with all fixes:
1. ✅ Conditional rectangle drawing (only in Rectangle Fill mode)
2. ✅ Old inpaint command removed from handler
3. ✅ Per-region inpainting with proper masking
4. ✅ Debug mode for diagnostics
5. ✅ GPU status indicator
6. ✅ Color extraction from original image

**Install and test**:
- `D:\Programs\koharu_0.1.11_x64-portable\koharu\target\release\bundle\nsis\koharu_0.1.11_x64-setup.exe`

Everything is ready! 🎉
